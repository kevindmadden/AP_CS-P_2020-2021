            Randomness
            Question of the Day: How do you go about generating random numbers?
            Answer: Associate numbers with something that is unpredictable. For example, you could use lava lamps.

            Video to watch about randomness generated with lava lamps (and more!):
            https://www.youtube.com/c/TomScottGo/videos

            Goal of the Day:
                Set the xVel to a random negative number whenever the rectangle hits the right wall.

        //  Math.random() returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
        //      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
        //  When a function returns a value, it means that the function call will ultimately
        //    turn into the returned value.
        //  For example, look at the below code that generates a random number and then logs it.
        console.log(Math.random())
        // Let's suppose that the random number generated is 0.5274086289651665.
        // After the Math.random() function is run, behind the scenes the code simplifies so that the returned
        // value "appears" where the Math.random() call was at formerly.
        // console.log(0.5274086289651665)
