         1. How do we efficiently create drawings that are just slightly different from each other?

         (a) Suppose you're driving down the highway at 70mph. If you travel 2 hours total, how many miles did you travel?
         70mph*2hours
         140 miles

         (b) You have already traveled 200 miles today. Right now you're driving down the highway at 70mph. If you travel 2 hours total, how many miles in total will you have traveled today?
         xPos = xPos + velocity*time
         xPos = 200 + 70*2


         (c) Suppose you have a square that is located at an xPos of 20. Let's say that this square is traveling at 50 pixels per second. Where is the square now located if it has traveled for 3 seconds?
            xPos = xPos + velocity*time
            xPos = 20 + 50*3
            xPos = 170

         (d) Suppose you have a square that is located at an xPos of 20. Let's say that this square is traveling at 50 pixels per second. Where is the square now located if it has traveled for a total of 1/60 seconds (decimal is 0.0166666667).
            xPos = xPos + velocity*time
            xPos = 20 + 50*(1/60)
            xPos = 20.8333333
            So let's say we want to figure out the next frame! So our square is currently at 20.8333333. Speed and framerate are the same.
            xPos = xPos + velocity*time
            xPos = 20.8333333 + 50*(1/60)
            xPos = 21.6666666

      Answer: Basic physics, velocity * time, etc.


    2. How do we get still drawings to flash by rapidly?
        Answer: Every 1/60th of a second, erase the entire canvas and draw the next frame.

        let xVel = 30 // pixels/sec

        let prevTimeStamp = 0
        window.requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop)
        function gameLoop(currentTimeStamp){
            let timeElapsed = (currentTimeStamp-prevTimeStamp)/1000
            prevTimeStamp = currentTimeStamp
            ctx.clearRect(0,0,500,500)

            xPos = xPos + xVel*timeElapsed
            ctx.fillRect(xPos,250,50,80)


            window.requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop)
        }
