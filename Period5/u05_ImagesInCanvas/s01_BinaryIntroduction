Today, we will be learning about binary.

Before beginning this lesson, please take this pre-quiz: https://forms.gle/ijYMapi2VJTxdUSq9 (Links to an external site.). This is not for a grade. If you do not know the answer to a question, then please just leave the question blank. Spend no more than 10 minutes on the pre-quiz.

After completing the pre-quiz, please watch the below two YouTube videos (~5 minutes each):

Final portion of lesson is video called:

2021-01-26 - Converting Binary to Base 10

I've posted a new video where I go over a few practice problems for converting binary numbers to base 10. The video is posted in the recordings archive and is called:

2021-01-27 - Convert Binary to Base 10 - More Practice

I include explanations with each practice problem. If you are getting the hang of things, you may be able to skip over the explanations for the last couple of problems.
